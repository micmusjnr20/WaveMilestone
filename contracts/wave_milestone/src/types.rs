/// - `guard_contract`: Address of the WaveGuard registry consulted for all
///   maintainer-privileged operations.  This value is immutable after pool
///   creation.  A compromised WaveGuard contract at this address can grant
///   arbitrary maintainer status and drain the pool.
/// - `maintainer`: The original pool creator.  Used as the sole authorized
///   caller for `clawback_expired_funds` (direct address equality — WaveGuard
///   is NOT re-checked on clawback to isolate the clawback path from a
///   potential WaveGuard compromise).
/// - `asset`: Must be a trusted Stellar Asset Contract (SAC).  A malicious
///   token could re-enter this contract during `transfer` calls or silently
///   fail, leaving pool accounting out of sync with actual token balances.
